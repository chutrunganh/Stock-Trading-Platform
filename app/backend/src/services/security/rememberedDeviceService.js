/**
 * Note on FingerprintJS Implementation:
 * This service uses the open-source version of FingerprintJS which provides:
 * - visitorId: A hash of browser/device attributes
 * - confidence: A score between 0 and 1 indicating reliability
 * 
 * Please notice that the fingerprintJS is open-source, while the fingerprintJS Pro or Fingerprint Indentification is not. Although
 * they all come from the same company, FingerprintJS Pro is a paid service that provides more features and better accuracy.
 * For more detail on API, access their official documentation: https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/HEAD/docs/api.md
 * 
 * We use the confidence score to determine whether to trust the fingerprint:
 * - Scores > 0.5 are considered reliable enough for device remembering
 * - Lower scores will require 2FA regardless of device status
